## Education
- **MS in Engineering Science**, CGPA: 3.7  
    State University of New York at Buffalo, 2021 – 2023, Buffalo, USA

- **BE in Electronics and Instrumentation**  
    Birla Institute of Technology and Science, 2016 – 2020, Hyderabad, India

## Professional Experience
- ### **Computer Vision Engineer** at Deepwalk Research Inc.
    Nov 7, 2023 - Present
    - Established ML infrastructure for data collection, processing, model training, and deployment.
    - Developed and trained an ML model for sidewalk segmentation using hand-annotated data.
    - Created a point cloud generation pipeline to filter outliers and low-confidence data, extracting structural information on a per-image basis. This pipeline utilized a hybrid structure-from-motion approach to improve global alignment and local depth accuracy.
    - Designed an efficient rasterization pipeline for converting point clouds to 2D representations from a top-down perspective, enhancing human and ML-assisted annotation. The efficiency was achieved through initial depth buffer generation to prevent pixel redraw due to frame overlap.

- ### **Research Assistant** at State University of New York at Buffalo
    Mar 3, 2023 - Nov 7, 2023
    - Conducted a comprehensive review of deep learning and ensemble methods for analyzing the impact of adversarial attacks.
    - Developed and evaluated ensemble deep learning models using various adversarial training strategies, focusing on unimodal approaches.
    - Enhanced ensemble diversity by incorporating advanced techniques to maintain model diversity during parallel training sessions.
    - Optimized the training of deep ensembles through vectorized computation and mixed-precision techniques.
    - Significantly improved the adversarial accuracy of ensemble models, surpassing the performance of individually adversarially-trained models.
    - Thoroughly assessed and validated the proposed methodologies, demonstrating their efficacy and theoretical soundness.
